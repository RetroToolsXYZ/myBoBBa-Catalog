## Why release?
I believe Habbo was built off releases and leaks of Habbo content! In case you don't fancy paying $70/100 dollars for this catalog from Puffin you can get somewhat of the latest 2024 version which is a few months behind compared to the current one used on MyBobba.

# Will you release an up-to-date version too?
Yes, I am working on it for you guys ðŸ’–

## Things you should know:
This catalog is in English. It does not contain product data and most of the custom furniture and newer Habbo furniture may not have proper names in the FurnitureData.json - in the end that's all aesthetics anyway, the furniture in this release will not disappoint,
It is possible to put this on an existing hotel with rooms and furni,
however some of the furni may become black boxes afterward- or all of it will, I cannot guarantee it depends on your current FurniData structure;
Marketplace is disabled, change page layout type and enable to make work;
HC Purchase Page is gone as it is all automatic on my hotel
Lots of extra furni that hasn't been fixed in the staff section
The catalog is as is and won't come with future updates;
Some tables may have special fields not in your database;
Clothing is hidden in the staff catalog, you must un-hide it yourself;
Way back when I was a noob a few Habbo lines got moved into other sections and still may be missing but idk;
You will need the latest badges from Habbo so be sure to merge my album1584 folder into yours.
The catalog includes exclusive items made for myBoBBa and a comprehensive VIP line.
Enjoy!
